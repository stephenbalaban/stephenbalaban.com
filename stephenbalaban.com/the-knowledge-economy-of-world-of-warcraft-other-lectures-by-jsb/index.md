Here are a couple of lectures that I ran across while checking out [Stanford's Entrepreneurship Corner](http://ecorner.stanford.edu/index.html). They share a lot in common with the [FlowOS we're building at yuanfen flow](http://www.yuanfenflow.com/projects/flowos).

- 5 minutes - [The Knowledge Economy of World of Warcraft](http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=2432)
- 5 min - [The old institutions are broken](http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=2426 )
- 2 minutes - [Shaping Serendipity](http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=2429)
