I came across a great quote today on page 285 of _On Lisp_.

> Lisp is like living in a rich country instead of a poor one: it may seem unfortunate that one has to work to stay thin, but surely this is better than working to stay alive, and being thin as a matter of course.

This holds for Haskell too. Exemplified here:Â [http://www.mit.edu/~mtikekar/posts/stream-fusion.html](http://www.mit.edu/~mtikekar/posts/stream-fusion.html "Haskell Stream Fusion").
