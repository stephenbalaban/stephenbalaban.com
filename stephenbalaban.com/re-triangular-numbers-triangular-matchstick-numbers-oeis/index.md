Last week I made a post about [Triangular Numbers](/triangular-numbers-arrays-edges-triangle-corporate-logo/). I posted a request for a new integer sequence on OEIS, which eventually got merged with an existing sequence, The Triangular Matchstick Numbers: [https://oeis.org/A045943]( https://oeis.org/A045943 "Triangular Matchstick Numbers").

I love math.

Here are the Triangular Matchstick Number Formulas:

**Recurrence Relation:**

```
a(0) = 0
a(n) = a(n-1) + 3*n
```

**Generating Function:**

```
a(n) = 3*n
----------
 (1-n)^3
```
