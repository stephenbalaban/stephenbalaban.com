Students and professors, let's ring in this fall semester with a tid-bit of Internet history. As you may already know, the Internet has it's origins in the defense industry.  Afterall, it was [APRANET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET) \[a [(D)ARPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA) project\] before it was the Internet. However besides being a military endeavor, it was also an academic one. [Usenet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet), "the poor man's ARPANET", was [created in 1980](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet#cite_note-Lueg-0) at Duke University. It became wildly popular within the academic community and birthed many Internet terms still in use today, [Flood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat_flood), [Spam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28electronic%29), [Troll](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29) and [FAQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAQ), among others.  But what of the forgotten ones?

> **Eternal September** (also **September that never ended**)[\[1\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September#cite_note-jargon-0) is a [Usenet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet "Usenet") slang expression, coined by Dave Fischer, for the period beginning September 1993.[\[2\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September#cite_note-1) The expression encapsulates the belief that an endless influx of new users ([newbies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newbie "Newbie")) since that date has continuously degraded standards of discourse and behavior on Usenet and the wider Internet.
