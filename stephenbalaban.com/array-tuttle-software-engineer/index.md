> **Array Tuttle:** Bloody eight line matrix multiplication. Huh! **Sam Iterative:** I suppose one has to expect a certain amount. **Array Tuttle:** Why? I came into this game for the action, the excitement. Go anywhere, travel light, five character GPU kernels, A ∘.× B, get in, get out, wherever there's a linear algebra problem, a man alone. Now they got the whole country doing imperative programming, you can't write a matrix multiplication without three for loops.

I think the future of programming languages will be something that looks APL and runs nicely on GPUs, FPGAs, and other parallel hardware architectures.
