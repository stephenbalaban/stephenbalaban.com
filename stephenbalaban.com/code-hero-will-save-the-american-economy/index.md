**You are going to die.**

Few try to change the world during their brief tenure, fewer still try to change it for the better. Few [step into the arena](http://www.stephenbalaban.com/2010/it-is-not-the-critic-who-counts-not-the/) and spend themselves for a worthy cause. From the moment you come kicking and screaming into this world, you're dying. By the time you're “educated” with a college degree, you're already 1/4 of the way out the door. What side of human progress are you?

It's inspiring to know people like [Alex Peake](http://alexpeake.com/). We're all capable of being catalysts of change in our environments; what have you done to change the world this month?
