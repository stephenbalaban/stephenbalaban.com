I was browsing a wikipedia article on [cellular automaton (CA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton "Cellular Automaton") and ran across a very interesting animated gif a glider gun in a torus wrap-around universe (think the game asteroids):

[![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d1/Long_gun.gif)](http://www.stephenbalaban.com/sandbox/glidergun.php) public domain from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Long_gun.gif)

I wondered if the animation would tessellate--and it does!
